## About The Project
- NSC-Event's [web-based](https://github.com/SeattleColleges/nsc-events-nextjs) frontend utilizes Typescript via `NextJs`.

- The [android-based](https://github.com/SeattleColleges/nsc-events-android) frontend was developed using `Koitlin` within `Android Studio`.

- `NestJs` was selected for [backend](https://github.com/SeattleColleges/nsc-events-nestjs) services also using Typescript. 

- `Google Cloud` powers our storage and `MongoDB` hosts our database.

## MVP Progress
As a student team primarily operating asynchronously, our journey commenced in late June '23, working diligently under a grant-approved program at NSC for the initial 100 days. Throughout the summer, we not only made significant strides in our project but also forged strong team bonds, marking our first collaborative experience. Collectively, we reached the milestone of MVP1 by November 3, 2023 within the mobile app.
